**MASS SPRING DAMPER**

**Overview**
Mass Spring Damper project is bulit using MATLAB Simscape and it has been observed that as we decrease the damping constant the slope of the X(displacement) vs t graph also decreases leaading to underdamped,overdamped and critically damped conditions.


**How project work**
The Simulink model define how data flows from one block to another. The Simscape model uses physical connections, which permit a bidirectional flow of energy between components.
The initial deflection for the spring is 1 meter is displayed in simscape model
